The current configuration (6/15/2018) displays three (3) results per page by default. This is due to my working with a very small set of test data.
If you wish to increase the default amount simply change the "ResultsPerPage" default variable in the two methods where it is used (In the HomeController Index Method and FilterUsers Method).
